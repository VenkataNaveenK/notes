# Python Exception Handling
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. **Syntax errors and Exceptions**.

Errors are problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program.

## Different types of exceptions in python
- **SyntaxError**: This exception is raised when the interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code, such as a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, or an unbalanced parenthesis.
- **TypeError**: This exception is raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of the wrong type, such as adding a string to an integer.
- **NameError**: This exception is raised when a variable or function name is not found in the current scope.
- **IndexError**: This exception is raised when an index is out of range for a list, tuple, or other sequence types.
- **KeyError**: This exception is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.
- **ValueError**: This exception is raised when a function or method is called with an invalid argument or input, such as trying to convert a string to an integer when the string does not represent a valid integer.
- **AttributeError**: This exception is raised when an attribute or method is not found on an object, such as trying to access a non-existent attribute of a class instance.
- **IOError**: This exception is raised when an I/O operation, such as reading or writing a file, fails due to an input/output error.
- **ZeroDivisionError**: This exception is raised when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
- **ImportError**: This exception is raised when an import statement fails to find or load a module.

## Exception syntax
```
try:
    # Some Code.... 

except:
    # optional block
    # Handling of exception (if required)

else:
    # execute if no exception

finally:
    # Some code .....(always executed)
```
## Raising Exception
```py
try: 
	raise NameError("Hi there")
except NameError:
	print ("An exception")
	raise
```
```title='output'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/d6ec14ca595b97bff8d8034bbf212a9f.py", line 5, in <module>
    raise NameError("Hi there")  # Raise Error
NameError: Hi there
```
## Advantages
- **Improved program reliability**: By handling exceptions properly, you can prevent your program from crashing or producing incorrect results due to unexpected errors or input.
- **Simplified error handling**: Exception handling allows you to separate error handling code from the main program logic, making it easier to read and maintain your code.
- **Cleaner code**: With exception handling, you can avoid using complex conditional statements to check for errors, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
- **Easier debugging**: When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter prints a traceback that shows the exact location where the exception occurred, making it easier to debug your code.
## Disadvantages
- **Performance overhead**: Exception handling can be slower than using conditional statements to check for errors, as the interpreter has to perform additional work to catch and handle the exception.
- **Increased code complexity**: Exception handling can make your code more complex, especially if you have to handle multiple types of exceptions or implement complex error handling logic.
- **Possible security risks**: Improperly handled exceptions can potentially reveal sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities in your code, so itâ€™s important to handle exceptions carefully and avoid exposing too much information about your program.
